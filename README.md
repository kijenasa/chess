# Chess
An online chess site written in Java, powered by Spring Boot and SQLite.
I made this as an entry into Spring Boot, and into backend development as a whole, as well as a submission for [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/).

## Deploying with Docker
Start by cloning and opening the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/kijenasa/chess.git
cd chess
```
Start it using Docker compose
This will build the image and container
```
docker compose up -d
```
